                    <strong>Restock Adequately:</strong> Consider replenishing your stock to ensure you have at least this many units available. 
                    Keeping your inventory aligned with forecasted demand helps you avoid lost sales or customer disappointment.

                    <strong>Plan Promotions Strategically:</strong> If the forecasted sales are below your expectations, 
                    consider running promotions or discounts to boost demand. Alternatively, if sales are high, you might raise prices slightly or bundle with other products.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Maintain Supplier Relationships:</strong> Forecasted demand helps you schedule timely orders from suppliers. 
                    Contact them early if you need more stock, ensuring smooth supply without last-minute scramble.
